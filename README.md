# Module 10: Working with geospatial data using sf

**Part 0: Download data**

The data files you'll need for the coding demo and homework are too large to store in this GitHub repository. Instead, you will have to download the data off of Moodle. The data are in two folders: `spatial_data` and `tabular_data`. Drop these two folders in the project directory for this module. **For this module in particular,** working from a R Project will save you a lot of headache. I recommend that you fork this repository, create a R Project from it, and then move the `spatial_data` and `tabular_data` folders to your project folder.

**Part 2: Complete homework**

The homework assignment is described in the `sf-homework` file, available as both `.html` and `.pdf`.
